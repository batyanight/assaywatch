# Roadmap

Scope for v0.1 is frozen in the build plan; new ideas go here, not into the sprint.

## Phase 0 (current)
- [x] repo, environment.yml, pre-commit, CI
- [x] YAML schema (pydantic) and validator
- [x] registry imported from the WCS spreadsheet (138 pathogen assays; 38 host/barcoding/universal primers excluded as out of scope)
- [ ] 5 assays promoted to `active`: Bd (Boyle 2004) done 2026-10-04 (stable, 100% of 54 recent);
      Bsal (Blooi 2013) and Oo ITS2 (Bohuski 2015) await their rDNA-query data; ranavirus MCP
      (Pallister 2007) and CDV P (Scagliarini 2007) were "watch" at ~88%
- [x] run `scripts/resolve_citations.py` once (2026-10-04): 64 DOIs verified, 21 taxids filled;
      5 BAD DOIs left for review. `scripts/check_taxids.py` found and fixed 3 wrong taxids
- [ ] name, license (MIT code / CC-BY registry), IP question asked in writing

## Phase 1: core pipeline
- [x] `match`: exhaustive vectorised search, both strands, held to brute force in tests
- [x] `score`: position-weighted penalty from config.yaml, five-way call per record
- [x] three-state base comparison: degeneracy and undetermined record bases cost nothing
- [x] inosine handled as a single promiscuous molecule, not as N
- [x] degeneracy accounting reported next to the drift signal, never scored
- [x] `screen` CLI: assays x FASTA -> TSV of calls
- [x] synthetic fixture set with hand-derived expected calls (61 records, 5 assays)
- [x] `retrieve`: Entrez esearch/esummary/efetch per taxid, mdat-filtered, gzip archive + manifest
- [x] wire the stages into a Snakefile with a checkpoint; SLURM profile
- [x] first live NCBI dry run (2026-10-03): 28 taxa fetchable whole, 19 needed gene-targeted queries
- [x] first live fetch (2026-10-03): 25 taxa, ~470k records, 1.1 GB; fixed dropped connections on genome-sized pages and expired history handles
- [x] gene-targeted retrieval groups; per-group screening
- [x] dry-run the gene-targeted groups; WGS contigs excluded for bacteria; influenza opted in
- [x] first full pipeline run (2026-10-03/04): N-gaps in scaffolds made pairing cubic; fixed
- [x] manifest is state, not a Snakemake output (it was being deleted each run); atomic writes;
      archives never overwritten; `scripts/rebuild_manifest.py`
- [x] cumulative reports from cached per-archive screens
- [x] screen large archives across cores (`screen --workers`, byte-identical output); biggest archives first
- [x] `drift`: Wilson / Newcombe intervals, minimum-evidence guard, evaluable denominator
- [x] assembly-level retrieval for bacterial targets (`asm` groups, NCBI Datasets): N complete
      genomes per release year, cut to credible amplicon windows
- [x] screen amplicons on both strands (minus-strand targets were never found)
- [x] `pair_evalue` per amplicon (chance.py); scoring guard available, off by default
- [x] `scoring.max_pair_evalue: 0.01`; flagged assays split into declining / low coverage (2026-10-04)
- [ ] check the two suspected oligo typos (Sarcocystis long rev, Circovirus Mankertz fwd) against
      the papers; flagged OLIGO_SEQ_SUSPECT in the registry
- [x] optional thermodynamic columns (`screen --thermo`, primer3-py): per-oligo Tm and ΔTm, never scored
- [x] `report`: markdown + self-contained HTML, per-year tables, coverage-gap table,
      degeneracy note beside the coverage trend
- [x] indel check (`scripts/indel_check.py`, 2026-10-04): across 69k sampled fail / one-primer
      no_amplicon calls, a clean single-base indel explains well under 1% of evaluable records
      for every assay but three. Gapped scoring (parasail) is not worth building. The three
      outliers are consistent same-position indels across all records, i.e. registry oligo
      typos, which makes the script a registry QA tool

## Later
- SLURM executor profile for Greene
- contributor template, two-week review promise
